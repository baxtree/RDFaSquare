<h2>About</h2>
<p>RDFa&sup2; is an on-line service which assists you in multi-topics annotation and
multi-contexts annotation using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014/">RDFa</a>. 
Under the guidance of RDFa&sup2;, you can personalize the generated Web page either by revising the XHTML+RDFa 
source codes and get the preview on the fly or by revising the intermediate template which can be
saved to the local memory for the future reuse.</p>

<p>When annotating a target on the Web page, a user is normally focused on the properties associated with
this target and ignores other resouces on this page temporarily. Based on this, RDFa&sup2; provides a
Topic Node Discovery approach to recommand targets to you when you are not aware of the important resources
inside RDF documents at the very beginning of annotating Web pages. Please use the <input type="button" value="Make a guess!" onclick=""/> button.</p>

<p>A single RDF document may or may not have more than one resource in which users are interested. RDFa&sup2; allows
you to annotate multiple topices derived from a single RDF document. Please use the <input type="button" value="Add Topics!" onclick=""/> button.
On the other hand, sometimes you may want to annotate a Web page using resources derived from multiple contexts (RDF documents). RDFa&sup2; also allows
you to fulfill this task using the <input type="button" value="Add Contexts!" onclick=""/> button.</p>

<p>By clicking on the <input type="button" value="Get the Complete Page" onclick=""/> button, you can easily get a 
ready-to-publish XHTML+RDFa page with the full features of a normal Web page. But if you have already got your Web
page as well as relevant RDF document(s) and want to reuse this page, you can use the <input type="button" value="Get the DIV Snippet" onclick=""/>
button to get a code snippet which can be easily copied and pasted to your Web page's &lt;body&gt; section.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you are a vocabulary curator or ontologist and want to publish your vocabulary represented in form of 
triples on a Web page which will be more human-readable. This is exactly the place where the <input type="button" value="Publish As a Vocabulary" onclick=""/> button come to play.
In this scenario, which nodes are topic nodes will not be an important question any more.
